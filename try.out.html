        <p class="font bmargin">The three main types of credit are installment, revolving and open.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="font" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Installment credit</b> is a loan with a fixed amount of money, fixed payments and an established<br>repayment schedule. </li>
            <li class="font" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Revolving credit</b> is a loan that allows you to continuously borrow money against a <span class="txtcolor2">line of credit</span><br>and pay it back with monthly payments. </li>
            <li class="font" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><b>Open credit</b> also allows you to continuously borrow money, but there are no interest rates and<br>you're required to pay your balance in full each month to avoid penalties. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="font">It's important to <span class="txtcolor2">understand the different types of credit</span> so you can confidently choose which one is<br>best for you and make informed borrowing desicions. Appropriately using various types of credit<br>contributes to your credit diversity (also known as your credit mix), which can help improve your<br>credit score.</p>
